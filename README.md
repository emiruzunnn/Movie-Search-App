# movie_search_app
 With the data provided from a movie dataset, research can be provided for the desired movie. If the name of the selected or searched movie is written and pressed on it, details are given. These details consist of a few content such as year, actor, subject. Javascript, HTML, CSS are used in this area.

 First of all, I entered the project with my html file. Then I tried to understand the API event given in the project tasks. After creating the API code, I did a research on how I could progress on the code. After the research, I created a roadmap for myself. With the roadmap I created, I divided it into 3 in my mind as search in javascript, details and favorites. I handled the first search field and the details field without any problems. Then I edited it with css. I aimed to beautify the image. However, due to the problems I have experienced in the favorites area, the favorites area is not actively working in the project. In the first process I started typing the Favorites field, the code continued to run smoothly, but then it started to not appear in the browser due to the problem of not being able to switch to another page. Afterwards, I sought a solution to the problem with my trials and research. But the solutions I found did not meet my request. I wanted you to leave this field in its latest form and see how I followed. I hope you will like it.
